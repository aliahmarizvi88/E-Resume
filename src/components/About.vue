        <p class="my-2 text-justify">
          Alongside frontend expertise, I have a little understanding of backend
          development, where I have worked with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
          to build and integrate RESTful APIs. This allows me to connect and run
          my frontend applications with backend services, ensuring that created
          template workflows across the stack.
